# CNN Model for MNIST Digit Classification

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented in Keras with a TensorFlow backend. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit classification.

## Introduction

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be highly effective in computer vision tasks, particularly in image classification. CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input data. This project focuses on using a CNN to classify handwritten digits, a classic problem in the field of machine learning.

## About CNN

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of deep neural networks that has proven to be highly effective in areas such as image recognition and classification. CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input data. They consist of convolutional layers that apply convolution operations to the input, typically followed by pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions. Fully connected layers and activation functions are often used to make final predictions.

## The MNIST Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). It is widely used as a benchmark dataset for machine learning and computer vision tasks. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit it represents.

## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the application of a CNN for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The CNN architecture includes convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss. Training progress is visualized using matplotlib.
